# Store Finder

Global pub giant Withoutaspoon, wants a pub finder that allows users to "Find your nearest store" for their website.

User should be able to enter their postcode or town or street name and get a list of the top ten nearest stores. Each store should have a distance, address, phone number, opening hours and a list of facilities and services (e.g. cash machine, car parking).

You'll have to build your own API to persist the store data and use an external api to find addresses from postcodes.

## MVP

- Search by postcode or town or street name
- A list of stores including the details of the stores
- A map marking the stores
- Use Geolocation to allow users to "use current location" to find stores
